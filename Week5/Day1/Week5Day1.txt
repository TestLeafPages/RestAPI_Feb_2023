Agenda For the Day:
=====================

one to place to another in Newyork 

mismandled and then once after reaching my destination
Assembling

Advantages:
============
Reuse
Time conservation
Easy adaptation
Based on the land measurement i can add /remove panels
Enhancement can be done easily
Cost of Maintainence  is low
Uniformity

Customer satisfaction

Can Normal Engineers construct/ work on panel framewor
They have to gain experience and Knowledge to construct panels


Framework helps us to complete the assigned works/Tasks in a easier way with less time consumption.It ensures low cost of maintainence and reusablitiy

Matschie Framework
==================

Developed by Testleaf and it is open source

Purpose of Matchie:
===================
To Automate only the API's and it based on BDD

People who can work on Matchie:
==============================
1) Manual Testers who are just learning Automation and want to convert to Automation 
2) People who work on BDD framework

Features  and libraries/tools available in Matchie:
==================================================

1) BDD -Cucumber
2) Build Tool -Maven
3) Execution/Runner -TestNG
4) Reporting - Allure Report

Features:
=========
1) BDD based + Services
BDD based- Postive cases and Business driven
Services --Negative Testcases

2) Low code Framework

Where we can implement Matchie Framework:
==========================================
1) Only for the API based Automation
2) Smaller Projects 

Automate Incident Management  by Individual without framework:
==============================================================
Create Incident --Ram
Update Incident -Aravind
Delete Incident -Sudarshan

There wont be proper Standard

Automation Framework
=====================
Framework Provides or sets the standard to achieve our Automation task easily and common to group of people who works

Common Advantages of Automation Framework:
===========================================

1)Uniformity
2)Reusablity
3)Time Conservation
4)Maintainence
5)Adaptability

Advantages of Matchie Framework:
================================
1)Low code BDD based Framework 
2)Easy Implementation
3)Reporting is achieved without any coding
4)Build with open source Libraries and Tools

2) Dependencies in Pom.xml
Most Dependencies for Allure Report --No code for allure reporting

3) Folder Structure and components 

src/test -- Not going to use in the Production or not moving to production

Hooks and Background

Background:

purpose:Executes before each and every scenario
Scope: only for a particular feature file

Hooks : 

Purpose:Executes before each and every scenario
Scope : For all Feature files


4) Execution and Generating Reports

Execution
===========

Right Click on the Project  --->Run As -Maven Test

Report Generation:
====================

1) Go to the project folder where pom.xml is present
2) Open Command Prompt from the same path 
3) Give the command to generate Allure Report

mvn allure:serve


Classroom Session:
==================
1) Import framework
2) Execute as Maven Test
3) Generate Allure report



While executing mvn allure:serve error is displayed as
mvn is not recognised


1) Download Maven
https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
apache-maven-3.9.1-bin.zip

2) Extract the Zip File and paste the maven folder in the desired location (preferably program files)

3) Open the bin folder from the maven file and copy the path 

Example path:
===============
C:\Program Files\apache-maven-3.9.1-bin\apache-maven-3.9.1\bin

4)Start menu -->Type environment --Edit Systeme Environment

5) Under System varaibles --Click on Path

6) Click on new and paste the copied maven path

7) Open new command prompt type mvn -version --maven version will be displayed

8) Open new command prompt and run mvn allure:serve
