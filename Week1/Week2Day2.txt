Recap of Yesterday's Session

Quick Catch Up on Why Postman to Test API and Limitations of Postman

Postman is most used tool for testing API's (Manual and Semi Automation)

Insomania , Postwoman

1) Collection Runner
2) Read data from the files
3) Have reports in postman
4) Integrate with Jenkins

Newman is the commandline tool for postman

Limitations:
=============
1) Parallel execution is not possible
2) CSV and Json .Only one file
3) execute collection from Commandline with newman
4) Integrate with newman for jenkins

chaining of requests

Today's Learning
==================
1)Get,Put,Patch and Delete for incidents

a)Validate response code and  Assert response body
b)Validate Response time in collection Level
c)Traversing through response and extract the values

https://jsonpathfinder.com/

1) Open the https://jsonpathfinder.com/ in browser
2) Copy the response from create incident and paste it
3) Search for sys_id and click on Sys_id
4) Copy  the response from json path finder and replace x with response variable

x.result.sys_id
resp.result.sys_id;
5) Print in the console
console.log(sys_id)





Class Room Session:
===================
 https://dev71160.service-now.com/api/now/table/change_request
1) Create a change request with response time validation.Extract the value of change request number
2) Update Change request and validate short description value is present in response
3) Delete the change request and validate response code



--------Class Room Practice Session -------------------------

2)Query Parameters

Filter the response
Query parameters are application specific

Servicenow (Rest API Explorer)
===============================
select the values for sysparm_fields and sysparm_limit

Postman:
========
Param Tab --Add Query parameters



a) Get and Post request for Incidents

------------Class Room Practice Session-------------------------
For Change Request Add the query parameters for 

Get and Post request 


3) Request/Response in XML Format and Traverse XML Response

Request Format  --Content type
Response Format --Accept 

Validate XML Response:
======================

1) Convert XML to json using snippet

Snippet name Response Body :convert XML body to a json object
var jsonObject = xml2Json(responseBody);

2) Traverse through converted json response
https://codebeautify.org/xmltojson

3) Copy the json response and paste it in https://jsonpathfinder.com/




4) Introduction to collection runner and run API's from collection

Collection runner --Run all requests under a collection in a single click with specified number of iteration sequentially

5) Export/Import Postman collections


6) Sample API Documentation
